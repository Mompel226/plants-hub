/* ============================================================
   progress.js — how a student is doing, everywhere.
   SHARED: labs-shared/progress.js is the source; each hub's build copies it in.

   Every app is served from one origin, nlcsbiology.com, so a lab's record in
   localStorage is readable by every hub. This file is the ONLY thing that knows how
   to read it, so a hub never has to know a lab's internals — add a lab to
   labs-shared/labs.json and it appears everywhere, with no hub changed.

   A lab keeps, under the key named in the register (NOT always <id>.v2 — the
   Classification Lab uses .v1):
     { <stationId>: { done:{i:true}, tried:{i:true}, per:{i:n}, one:{i:true}, sig, first } }
   and, once anything has reached the teacher's records, <id>.submitted = { at, sent, name }
   (older copies carry { name, form, code, at, sent } from the days of handing in).

   Nothing here writes to a lab's record. Read only.
